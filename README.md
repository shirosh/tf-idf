# tf-idf

In the given problem, TF-IDF is applied to the book text and taxonomy data. Each book section is transformed into a TF-IDF vector representation, where each component of the vector corresponds to the TF-IDF score of a specific term in the document. Similarly, each taxonomy entry is also represented as a TF-IDF vector.
